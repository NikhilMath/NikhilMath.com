    <p class="intro">
      Hello, welcome to my website. My name is Nikhil (pronounced like Nik-Kill). I am 24 years old, born and raised in
      Logan, Utah. I currently go to Utah State University for Communications with a minor for Non-Profit work with
      homeless shelters. I always wanted to work at a resource center down in SLC, but lately during the pandemic while
      doing nothing this summer, I got the itch to learn how to be better at coding so that is why I am taking this
      class.
    </p>

      Right now, I work at a call center, taking calls for customers who want to cancel and help them either cancel or
      stay with us. Most customers who want to cancel usually want to cancel because they are fed up with the company.
      That pretty much makes every single call usually a call from an angry customer, which is sufficient to say, makes
      me want a different career sooner than later.
    </p>

      This summer I got into making comedic skits on YouTube, I tried to upload a new skit every three days with my old
      roommates. It was really fun but hard work sometimes when you had to convince the other roommates that their jokes
      arenâ€™t funny enough to be filmed. I believe I am funny person to be around, but I have been told otherwise on
      occasions. Although I like to assume all those people have a bad sense of humor.
